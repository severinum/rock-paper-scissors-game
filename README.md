# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is code for a simple version of the game but not the simplestt that you can make (one based on massive number of if statements and a chance to break code even more if you have a need to add new element to the game).

With this version of the game you can add as many new elements that you want. 

In Game 2 (sample code in GameTester.java file) you can notice, that I've added new game element : water
Water winns against paper (melts it), scissors (rust is destroying them) but looses agains rock (like in real life aka river).
