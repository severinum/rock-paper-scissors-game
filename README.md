# Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is code for a simple version of the game but not the simplestt that you can make (one based on massive number of if statements and a chance to break code even more if you have a need to add new element to the game).

With this version of the game you can add as many new elements that you want. 

In Game 2 (sample code in GameTester.java file) you can notice, that I've added new game element : water
Water winns against paper (melts it), scissors (rust is destroying them) but looses agains rock (like in real life aka river).

"first commit" contain all the code and all functionalities described above. Maybe with the time I am going to add new functionalities.
I am planning to add round to the game in new version. For example there will be 10 rounds and Player with the highest score (number of wins) is going to be a final winner of the tournament.
